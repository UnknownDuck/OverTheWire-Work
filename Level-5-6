This file contains the level work for 5-6

First I cd'ed into the inhere hidden file

then I ls -a to see all the hidden files in the dirct

then I used the du -a command to see all the file sizes 

then I used the du -a -b to see the byte size of all files 

then found that maybehere07 had a file with 1033 bytes file

then opened maybehere07 directory and used the du -a -b

found it was file2 and used cat ./.file2 to find the flag

flag = DXjZPULLxYr17uwoI01bNLQbtFemEgo7

It worked!!!
