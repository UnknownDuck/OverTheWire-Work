the goal of this is to find the content of a filename with spaces 
https://linuxopsys.com/topics/how-to-read-filename-with-spaces-in-linux

I used the link above to use the commmand cat injunction with '   '   allowing me to obtain the flag

cat 'spaces in this filename'

flag = UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
